## Hunter CS Catalog  
_What do I even need to graduate?_  
The interactive program to help you answer that question figure out the classes
you need to finish getting your degree.
Able to check:
- What kind of CS classes are needed to graduate.
- The pre-reqs and co-reqs for each class.

We're planning to use the terminal interface to test-out all implemented features for now before beginning to host it on the web, possibly with react or flask.
